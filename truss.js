   TRUSS OS — SHOWROOM ENGINE
   Engineering Firm OS · Powered by Accelerated Experiences LLC

   BROWSER-ONLY SHOWROOM. No backend, no network. sessionStorage, resets on idle.
   Faithful to AEHub canon: Founder -> COO -> DH -> AE -> Event Bus -> Pacemaker
   -> Triad (2 opposing lenses), confidence-gated release, LIVE/ESTIMATE/ASSUMPTION
   tags, the Fences (drafts only, nothing sent).

   THE THESIS: you do NOT build a separate OS per engineering discipline. You
   build ONE engine on the universal core every firm shares — time, budget,
   scope, the multiplier — and switch a MODULE (Civil / Mechanical / Software)
   for the discipline-specific workflow. That toggle is the headline.

     1) CONCIERGE — explains the agent organization, how the system works,
        customization/white-label, and live pricing (pulled from the OS's own

     2) OPERATOR — business/operational questions route through the real agent
